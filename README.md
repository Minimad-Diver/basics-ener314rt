# basics-ener314rt
The basics for the ENER314-RT - turn ENER002 dumb sockets on and off.

Inspect the contents of the HopeRF_TRX(ENER002) folder. Each file has lines commented...
Make a copy of the Energenie-issued HopeRF_TRX(ENER002) folder, overwrite app_main.c, dev_HRF.c & Makefile with the ones from this Git repo, and make away!

You can try the 4 files in the binaries folder - these have worked for some people, but not for others *shrug*
They'll need chmod +x * running on them.
